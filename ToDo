Robert's Important things to do:

   - it looks like we really need some resolution on the examples. The way that
     they are run we might need to have a hdf5.file.close, 
     (this would have to see if there were any open dataset or group pointers)

   - the examples need some way to unlink/remove files

   - getting R attributes and hdf5 attributes into line
     <I am starting to think that they should not align but should be thought 
      of as completely separate things >

   - better tools for hdf5 plists

   - data conversion (int to real seems a problem)
         as.single.hdf5.dataset needs to be fixed (in .C/.Fortran we somtimes 
         really need singles).
   - strings/ objects/ factors... as types for HDF5 files.
     <Oct 20, I got somewhere with strings as attributes today >

   - HDF5 groups -- we need to start looking at them. Also, I think we want a 
     subset of this where the group contains only conforming arrays. I believe
     that we can get apply of a sort to work on these structures.

  It appears that R and HDF5 disagree on order (one is C and the other FORTRAN  
   by default). I think life will be easier if we start controlling this 
  explicitly. 
  As a result I believe that some of the subset assignment stuff is 
  substantially   incorrect

  Philosophy:
        - HDF5 obtains data from a dataset by using a dataspace.
        - we don't have that concept in R and it would be rather 
          peculiar to introduce.
        - I think what we should provide is the ability to create dataspaces,
          to manipulate them (provide essentially direct calls to their entire
          H5S suite)
        - then let users do a dataspace select to obtain a vector which they
          will have to sort out

Byron's Important Things To Do:

* Add hard/soft linking code. Trivial, I just haven't done it yet
* Dataspace iterator. My original one was too slow, rework to include
  useful things like caching. No iterator code is in the codebase
  release right now (sorry)
* Find places where I'm not properly type-checking
* Switch over to the HDF5 fail-out error mode (to avoid nasty
  printouts)
Extras:
   - do we want a HDF5 connection class -- seems like it could be 
     useful
